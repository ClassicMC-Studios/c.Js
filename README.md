# ?
c.Js is a tiny Js game engine thing inspired by, 24a2 that was designed to not be very large.
It can be used in TypeScript orJavaScript.
## How do I use it?
Download the repository and open the game.js file <br />
  Go under the  const cjs = new Cjs();  code line and you can start under there. <br />
  There are only 6 commands in cJs <br />
  cjs.clear();  cjs.rect(); cjs.backGround(); cjs.text(); cjs.end(); cjs.getRandomInt(); <br />
  There are 32 squares that can be modified <br />
  cjs.clear(); will reset the squares back to the main color <br />
  cjs.rect(); has 2 modifiers Number & Color <br />
  the number modifier will will select which of the 48 squares gets modified <br />
  the Color modifier will will choose the color of the square using Hex <br />
  For example cjs.rect(1,"#ff0000"); will make the first square in the screen red. <br />
  The rest of the commands are just extras <br />
  
And thats about it.
